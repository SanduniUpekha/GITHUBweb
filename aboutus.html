        A world where every child of learning age completes their basic education without considering poverty as an obstacle.

        <br><br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;">  Many children in Sri Lanka have been forced to drop out of school due to poverty. At a young age, they have to carry the burdens of home and work. The aim of our organization is to eradicate poverty so that helpless children who are unable to achieve their goals due to lack of proper basic education can successfully reach their goals. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;"> To achieve these goals, the life care organization has developed a series of different projects. Our objective is to raise the necessary funds from these projects and to create an environment conducive to the proper education of children of learning age and to provide all the facilities required for the successful completion of basic education.</p>
        <p p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;"> A series of life care programs have been organized not only to help poverty alleviate learning but also to uplift the mental and spiritual well-being of young children.The reason why the life care organization is focusing on this is because first and foremost they have a good understanding of the importance of having good mental and spiritual well-being for children. Because despite having everything you need, it is difficult to prioritize learning without mental health.</p>
